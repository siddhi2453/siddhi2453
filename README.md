Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a **self-taught Data Science student** on a mission to learn, build, and grow—one project at a time.

# 🚀 About Me

- 🌱 Currently learning all things **Data Science**—from Python basics to machine learning and AI.
- 🤖 Exploring new concepts with the help of ChatGPT, online resources, and hands-on experimentation.
- 📚 This account is my open journal: I use it to **track my progress, share daily projects**, and document my journey as I work towards becoming a capable data scientist.
- 🗒️ I believe in learning by doing, and I'm excited to look back at how far I've come.

# 🛣️ My Learning Path

- Python Fundamentals
- Data Analysis (Pandas, Numpy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
